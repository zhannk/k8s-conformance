# To reproduce

## Set up the cluster

1. Login to https://dev.kubermatic.io/.
2. Press the "Create Cluster" button.
3. Pick Kubernetes version v1.26.x.
4. Complete the create cluster wizard with either DigitalOcean, Hetzner or AWS (setting the "Allowed IP Range for NodePorts" field to "`0.0.0.0/0`" to allow all inbound trafic).

When the cluster is up and running,

1. Download the kubeconfig file.
2. Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable `export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig`.

## Run the conformance test

Download a [binary release](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/releases) of the CLI, or build it yourself by running:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
```

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster with:

```
$ sonobuoy run --mode certified-conformance --dns-pod-labels "app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-dns,app=coredns"
```

View actively running pods:

```
$ sonobuoy status
```

To inspect the logs:

```
$ sonobuoy logs
```

Once `sonobuoy status` shows the run as `completed`, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to a local directory:

```
$ outfile=$(sonobuoy retrieve)
```

This copies a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local
`.` directory. Extract the contents into `./results` with:

```
mkdir ./results; tar xzf $outfile -C ./results
```
